## Quick Start

If you are creating a new website, the quickest way to get up and running is to
add the theme as a Hugo module:
```bash
hugo new site NewSite
cd NewSite
hugo mod init github.com/<user>/<website_name>
hugo mod get github.com/splatrac/chillpreneur
```


The folder `hugoBasicExample` contains a working version of a website with the
theme. It includes: the configuration file `config.yaml`, the content folder
`content` and the `data` folder. It's a good idea to copy this over to the
project folder to get an initial version of the website up and running.


Now `hugo server` will start the local development server with a working
version of the website with the theme.
